# Front-End Journey: From Mockups to Code

The development of an application starts before the implementation of its core logic and functionalities. An initial journey of business analysis, test prototypes and design of reusable patterns is important to guarantee good alignment and to give the development team a good quick start to speed up the development.
This journey goes through 3 different stages:

1. Starts with a **UX Concept**, where you’ll try to translate the business requirements into some workflows and wireframes.

1. Then goes to a **UI** Designer that will create High-Fidelity mockups to provide a good overview on what the application would look like.

1. Next step is the **Front-End Development**, where we convert the mockups into application screens and user interactions.
