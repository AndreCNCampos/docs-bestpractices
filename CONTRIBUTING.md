# How to contribute to the docs

We invite you to take part in creating and maintaining documentation. Here are some notes to get you started.

## Steps to edit the docs

1. Fork the repository. [Try it out first](<https://help.github.com/en/articles/fork-a-repo#fork-an-example-repository>), if you prefer.
2. Choose the right content, edit it, and commit. You can do this as many times as needed.
3. [Create a pull request](<https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork>) and enter the information about your edits.

After you create the pull request, we'll review the content. We may also add some notes and comments in the pull request.

## Choose the type of content

You can roughly classify the documentation in one of the three groups of content:

* :blue_book: conceptual (intros and docs about how things work - [example](../src/managing-the-applications-lifecycle/containers/intro.md))
* :hammer: procedural (mostly numbered lists on how to do something - [example](../src/develop/ui/screen-templates-create/intro.md))
* :information_source: referential (usually tables listing extra details - [example](../src/ref/apis/outsystems-api-requestinfo-api.md))

It's generally more straightforward to create and edit **procedural** and **referential** content. 

## Get familiar with Markdown

We use the Markdown markup language to write the documentation. Check this [syntax overview](<https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/#syntax>) to get started.

Thank you! :octocat:
